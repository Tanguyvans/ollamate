## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Framework:** [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (Rust backend, webview frontend)
- **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with TypeScript)
- **Routing:** [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- **Language Model Interface:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) via [ollama-rs](https://github.com/pepperoni21/ollama-rs) (Backend)
- **Database:** [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) via [tauri-plugin-sql](https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/tree/v1/plugins/sql) (Frontend Bindings)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Package Manager:** [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (or npm/yarn)

## Setup & Installation üöÄ

**Prerequisites:**

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Cargo
- Node.js and a package manager ([Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation), npm, or yarn)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running locally with at least one model pulled (e.g., `ollama run llama3.2:1b`).
- Tauri prerequisites for your specific OS (see [Tauri prerequisites guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/)).

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tanguyvans/ollamate.git
    cd ollamate
    ```
2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    # or npm install / yarn install
    ```
3.  **Install Rust dependencies (including Tauri plugins):**
    Tauri should handle this automatically when you run the dev or build command, but ensure the `sqlite` feature is enabled for `tauri-plugin-sql` in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`.
4.  **(Optional) Generate App Icons:** Place your 1024x1024 app icon (e.g., `app-icon.png`) in `src-tauri/` and run:
    ```bash
    bun tauri icon src-tauri/app-icon.png
    ```
5.  **Run in development mode:**
    ```bash
    bun tauri dev
    ```
6.  **Build the application:**
    ```bash
    bun tauri build
    ```
    The executable will be in `src-tauri/target/release/`.

## Usage üìù

1.  Ensure Ollama is running locally.
2.  Launch the Ollamate application.
3.  The app will connect to your local Ollama instance to fetch available models.
4.  Select a model from the dropdown in the chat view.
5.  Use the sidebar to:
    - Navigate between Home, Chats, and Settings.
    - Click **"+ New Chat"** to create and name a new conversation thread.
    - Click on an existing chat name to load its history.
    - Hover over a chat name and click the '√ó' button to delete it.
6.  Go to **Settings** to modify the global system prompt used for all chats.
7.  Type your prompts in the input box at the bottom of the chat view and press Enter or click the Send button.
